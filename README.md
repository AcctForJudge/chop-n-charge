# chop-n-charge
based on a game i used to play in school with friends

basically there were attacks that consumed charges, and defenses that were free
every turn, we would either charge up, or use one of the attacks that used up some of the charges
the blocks were very specific, like a one to one match up

tried to make something similar, cuz i was bored. no assets and pretty stuff here tho, just kinda made it
opponent is just randomly picking the options based on its and player's charges

its shit but oh well
